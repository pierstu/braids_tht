- Each folder consist in `braids` and `braids_bootloader`subfolders, containing _all_ build files

- [/braids](https://github.com/pierstu/braids_tht/tree/master/braids) contains portage from original Braids files by Emilie Gillet (emilie.o.gillet@gmail.com) in her [Eurorack GH repo](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack)

- [/bees](https://github.com/pierstu/braids_tht/tree/master/bees) contains portage from Tim Churches' [Bees in the Trees](https://github.com/timchurches/Mutated-Mutables)
